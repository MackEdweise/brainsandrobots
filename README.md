A repo containing programming projects related to my overall goal to develop an educational electronics and robotics lab named K-9.

K-9 is a personal robotics project. The robot has a plywood chassis based on the BBC’s schematics of the K-9 robot from Doctor Who, built using AutoCAD and electric woodworking tools. The robot has a built in floppy-drive CNC machine that was home made using stepper motor drivers, Arduino, and Grbl open source g-code parser. The robot's circuitry includes a unique breadboard-mounted 8-bit computer processor that I designed and assembled using IC packages. An h-bridge controlled geared motor system provides K-9 with mobility. An embedded Raspberry Pi manages the entire system. I programmed the Raspberry Pi using Open CV, Espeak, Python and C++ to solve math problems in unique ways, using all of the robot’s systems as output methods. This allows K-9 to "write" his solutions using the CNC machine, "say" his solutions using Espeak, and "blink" his solutions on the 8-bit processor. I used PyLauncher, the open source TCP/IP socket server software, to control K-9 over WiFi using my android phone. K-9 was showcased at the 2015 MakerExpo at Kitchener City Hall.
